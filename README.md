Task 3: Hospital Management System with JSP, Servlet, and JDBC

To develop a Hospital Management System using JSP, Servlet, and JDBC, you'll need to structure your project into several modules as outlined: Staff Information Management, Patient Management, and Appointment Scheduler. Here's a breakdown of how you can approach each module:

### 1. Staff Information Management

**Database Design:**
- Create a `doctors` table in your database with fields such as `doctor_id`, `name`, `specialization`, `contact_info`, etc.

**Functionality:**
- **Add Doctor:**
  - Create a JSP form (`addDoctor.jsp`) to input doctor details.
  - Handle form submission in a Servlet (`AddDoctorServlet`) to insert data into the `doctors` table using JDBC.
  
- **View Doctors:**
  - Fetch and display all doctors from the database (`ViewDoctorsServlet`).
  
- **Update Doctor:**
  - Implement functionality to edit doctor details (`editDoctor.jsp` and `EditDoctorServlet`).
  
- **Delete Doctor:**
  - Provide an option to delete a doctor from the database (`DeleteDoctorServlet`).

### 2. Patient Management

**Database Design:**
- Create a `patients` table with fields like `patient_id`, `name`, `dob`, `gender`, `doctor_id` (foreign key), etc.
- Additional tables for prescription and drug information if required (`prescriptions`, `drugs`).

**Functionality:**
- **Add Patient:**
  - Implement a form (`addPatient.jsp`) to collect patient details and link to a doctor.
  - Use a Servlet (`AddPatientServlet`) to insert patient data into the database.

- **View Patients:**
  - Display all patients and their details (`ViewPatientsServlet`).

- **Update Patient:**
  - Allow editing patient information (`editPatient.jsp` and `EditPatientServlet`).

- **Delete Patient:**
  - Provide functionality to remove a patient (`DeletePatientServlet`).

### 3. Appointment Scheduler

**Database Design:**
- Create an `appointments` table with fields like `appointment_id`, `doctor_id`, `patient_id`, `appointment_date`, `status`, etc.

**Functionality:**
- **Schedule Appointment:**
  - Create a form (`scheduleAppointment.jsp`) to select a doctor, patient, and date/time.
  - Implement a Servlet (`ScheduleAppointmentServlet`) to insert appointment details into the database.

- **View Appointments:**
  - Display scheduled appointments (`ViewAppointmentsServlet`).

- **Approve/Cancel Appointment:**
  - Allow doctors to approve or cancel appointments (`ApproveAppointmentServlet`, `CancelAppointmentServlet`).

### Additional Considerations

- **Authentication and Authorization:**
  - Implement user authentication (login/logout) for doctors and possibly admin roles.
  
- **Error Handling and Validation:**
  - Validate user inputs to prevent SQL injection and ensure data integrity.
  
- **Frontend Design:**
  - Use JSP for dynamic content generation and HTML/CSS for frontend design.
  
- **Database Connectivity:**
  - Use JDBC to connect to your database and execute SQL queries.

This structure provides a comprehensive foundation for your Hospital Management System. Each module involves creating JSP pages for user interaction, Servlets for processing requests, and JDBC for database operations. Ensure to handle exceptions, manage sessions securely, and validate inputs thoroughly to build a robust and efficient system.
